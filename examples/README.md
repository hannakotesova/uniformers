# Examples
The examples in the further subdirectories are helpful for understanding how
this library works and also for reproducing the results of our paper [ByGPT5:
End-to-End Style-conditioned Poetry Generation with Token-free Language
Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10474). The examples are structured as
follows:

* The [inference](inference) directory contains scripts for model inference,
  e.g., generating text or quatrains and performance analysis.
* The [statistics](statistics) directory contains scripts for computing dataset
  statistics.
* The [training](training) directory contains scripts for training models for
  language modeling or poetry generation.

Each script has a command line interface and additional information can be
found by invoking them with the ``--help`` flag.
