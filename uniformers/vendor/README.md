# Vendored Code

This module stores vendored code taken from other research projects which were
not directly installable and/or needed refactoring to be usable with this
project. Currently it only includes
[code](https://github.com/mt-upc/transformer-contributions) from the paper
[Measuring the Mixing of Contextual Information in the
Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04212.pdf).
